To my best understanding, program1 fulfills the following requirements for week3 prove:
    -Variables
    -Expressions
    -Conditionals
This program employs basic input requests and checks for correct input. Evaluating input values determines the response printed to the screen. 

In order to replicate this program, do the following: 
    -Install Visual Studio Code
    -Install Python and Github extensions
    -Sign-in and connect to an existing Github account and repository
    -Set a variable equal to a prompted value with a message asking for a name
    -Check that the variable is set properly by displaying a welcome message repeating the variable value
    -Prompt input gauging how the user is doing between 1 to 10
    -Check that the number input is 1. A number-digit, not a string and 2. Is a whole number
    -Display a message responding to how well user is doing, and ask if they or someone they know got Covid-19
